To run the system completely offline:

1. Execute the Windows application: python pos_gui.py

2. The system will create a local database file (pos_system.db)

3. You can process sales, manage products, and generate reports

4. Sales data will be stored locally until you have an internet connection

5. When you eventually connect to the internet, the system can sync all the locally stored data to the cloud backend.
